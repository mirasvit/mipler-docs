### ⭐ Built for Shopify

Meeting the **Built for Shopify** standards was a challenging journey. After a few months of hard work, we finally achieved **Built for Shopify** status — a recognition of the highest level of app excellence that surpasses other app highlights.

## 🗓️ Feb 2025

* Enhanced application performance
* Implemented major interface improvements for a better user experience
* Updated the daily email templates

## 🗓️ Jan 2025

* Moved the app to Shopify's built-in (embedded) mode. By default, the app now opens inside the Shopify admin, with the option to open a standalone interface as before.
* Switched to the GraphQL API for products and variants.
* Enhanced query optimization algorithm, reducing execution time for long-running queries by up to 20%.
* Consolidated output limits: The default display row limit is now 100,000, and the export row limit is also 100,000. These limits can be increased upon request by contacting the support team.

## 🗓️ Dec 2024

* Improved task processing logic by implementing independent processes for each task, reducing the risk of memory leaks.
* Updated the UI to use the Shopify Polaris design system. Allowing users to interact with the app in a familiar interface.
* Added the `customer_addresses` table as a default component to the data model.

## 🗓️ Jan 2023

After months of dedicated effort, we are proud to announce the launch of a new version of our platform.

This release features a comprehensive overhaul of the business calculation definition syntax, making it more robust and user-friendly.

The update is powered by **ACE** (Advanced Calculation Engine), a powerful tool that enables users to perform calculations on their data using a syntax that is similar to Excel.

With ACE, you can manipulate your data with greater ease and precision, making it a valuable addition to any data analysis workflow.

After several months of hard work, we finally released a new platform version with a fully updated business calculation definition syntax.  👌
