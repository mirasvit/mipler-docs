# The Report or Export Doesn’t Have a Complete Data Set

If you notice missing records in a report or exported file from Mipler, it is likely due to a **record limit** being set in the report settings.

---

## Steps to Resolve

1. **Open the Report**  
   Open the relevant report in Mipler.

2. **Check the Record Limit**  
   Navigate to the **record limit** in the report settings:  
   <img src="/docs/img/troubleshoot/report-dont-have-complete-data-set/s1_1.png" />

3. **Adjust or Reset the Limit**  
   Click on the record limit to adjust or reset it if necessary:  
   <img src="/docs/img/troubleshoot/report-dont-have-complete-data-set/s1_2.png" />

4. **Export the Report**  
   Re-export the report to ensure all records are included.

By increasing or removing the record limit, you can ensure that all records are included in your reports and exports.
