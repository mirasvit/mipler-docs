# The report or export doesn’t have a complete data set

If you notice that some records are missing from a report in the app or from an exported report, it is likely due to a *
*records limit** being set.

---

## Steps to Resolve

1. Open the relevant report in Mipler.
2. Check the specified **record limit** in the report settings:

3. Adjust or reset the record limit by click on it, if necessary.

4. Export the report again to ensure all records are included.

By increasing the record limit, you can resolve issues with missing records in your reports and exports.
