# Metafields are empty

If Metafield columns in Mipler appear empty despite having data in Shopify, it's likely that **Metafield synchronization
** isnâ€™t enabled in your Mipler account settings. By default, Metafields are not synchronized in Mipler because not all
clients require this resource, and enabling it can significantly impact server performance.

---

## Steps to Resolve

1. Navigate to the **Settings** page in your Mipler account.
2. Scroll to the **Metafields Synchronization** section at the bottom of the page:

3. Enable the resources you need to begin synchronization.

### Important Notes

- The time required for synchronization depends directly on the volume of your data.
- Once enabled, Metafield data will be synchronized, and the previously empty columns in your reports should display the
  expected data.
