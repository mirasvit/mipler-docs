# Metafields Are Empty

If Metafield columns in Mipler appear empty despite having data in Shopify, it is likely that **Metafield Synchronization** is not enabled in your Mipler account settings. By default, Metafields are not synchronized in Mipler because not all clients require this resource, and enabling it can significantly impact server performance.

---

## Steps to Resolve

1. **Access the Settings Page**  
   Navigate to the **Settings** page in your Mipler account.

2. **Locate the Synchronization Section**  
   Scroll to the **Metafields Synchronization** section at the bottom of the page:  
   <img src="/docs/img/troubleshoot/metafields-are-empty/s1_1.png" />

3. **Enable Synchronization**  
   Select the resources you need to synchronize, and enable them to start the process.

### Important Notes

- **Synchronization Time**: The time required for synchronization depends directly on the volume of your data.
- **Updated Reports**: Once synchronization is enabled, Metafield data will be synced, and the previously empty columns in your reports should display the expected data.
