This option allows you to sort the report in different ways.  
For example, it is possible to sort orders by date of creation to see the newest orders at the top;  
or sort orders by the amount to see the greatest orders at the top.

### Sorting types
- Ascending (A-Z, 1-9). Smaller values will be at the top of the report.
- Descending (Z-A, 9-1). Inverted to the ascending. Higher values will be at the top of the report.
