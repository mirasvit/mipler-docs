## How Mipler connects your data everywhere

Mipler is more than just analytics — it’s the **data hub for your business**. It unlocks a wide range of integration options with the tools you use daily — from Google Sheets to enterprise BI platforms or no-code automation tools.

### Mipler allows you to:

* 🔗 **Connect reports directly to Google Sheets or Excel** — get live data updates without manual exports.
* 📤 **Share reports in multiple formats (HTML, CSV, PDF, XLSX, JSON)** — create public or private links, password-protected if needed.
* ⚙️ **Use Mipler as a data source via API** — build custom queries with MQL (Mipler Query Language) and receive results in the format you prefer (JSON, CSV, etc.).

### What it means in practice

Mipler can integrate at any level:

* **No code** — directly from the interface using “Share” or “Insert into Google Sheets”.
* **Low code** — by using MQL queries through simple URLs or API calls.
* **Full developer mode** — connecting your own apps or analytics pipelines through the REST API.

### The main advantage of Mipler integrations

Mipler adapts to your workflow. You don’t need to adjust to the system — you simply choose the format that works for you:
* 💡 **For analysts** — quick access to up-to-date reports in spreadsheets.
* 🔍 **For managers** — easy access to live KPIs via a secure link.
* 🤖 **For developers** — clean, flexible API returning structured data for automation or analytics.

Mipler becomes your team’s single source of truth — always up-to-date data, wherever you need it.
